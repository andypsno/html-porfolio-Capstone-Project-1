<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Draw</h2>
<p>I love draw it's the something most relax of the world for me. Sometimes I have a pencil and just I draw where ever
  or when ever. I would like to be an artist someday. I practiced some arts techniques for example oil, acrylic,
  watercolor, graphite. In addiction, I like digital art with differents styles for example comic, manga, cartoonish,
  pixelart, voxelart, models 3D. </p>
<h2>Videogames</h2>
<p>I grew around with videogames. I think it was make a mark on myselft and for the reason who I'm, my personality to be
  honest. Some games i like are Minecraft, Terraria, Mario Kart and God of War III Remastered and Ragnarok.</p>
<h2>Hiking</h2>
<p>Actually I think this is the activity that I do less. I know maybe I could go out more but sometimes in my country is
  difficult
  to go out or only if you want to go out means spend a lot of money but sometimes I give me a gift like
  hiking in a mountain.</p>
